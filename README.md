## SUMMARY
This project utilizes image processing technologies to process marked optical sheets within seconds, compare them against a reference answer sheet, and analyze the number of correct and incorrect markings. At the end of the process, the student's score is calculated and written in the designated "score" section of the optical form. In the background, the project leverages OpenCV and NumPy libraries. Developed using Python, this project has the potential to replace optical form reading machines, offering schools, private institutions, and similar organizations a cost-effective alternative.

## INTRODUCTION

### Importance of the Topic
In modern times, optical form readers are widely used in exam evaluation processes to save time and labor. These devices enable fast and accurate conversion of paper markings into digital data. This project introduces an optical form reader developed using the Python programming language. By leveraging the power of OpenCV and NumPy libraries, the detection and analysis of markings on the form have been made possible.

The project's goal is to provide a low-cost, flexible, and open-source alternative to optical readers commonly used in educational institutions and exam centers. Although there are numerous OMR (Optical Mark Reader) systems and devices available, their maintenance is often difficult and involves additional costs. Schools, being one of the primary users of this technology, face significant challenges due to their limited financial resources, making it difficult to purchase and operate these devices. However, using standard scanners and software to process and evaluate optical forms can make exams faster, cheaper, and more accessible for such institutions.
